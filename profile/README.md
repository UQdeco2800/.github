# DECO2800 Design Computing Studio 2 - Testing & Evaluation
[DECO2800](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=DECO2800 "DECO2800 Description") is a junior level course in the [Bachelor of Information Technology degree](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-information-technology-2453 "BIT Description") at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/ "UQ Home Page") in [Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane "Information about Brisbane") [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Information about Australia"). Students learn tools and techniques to build and deliver sophisticated software systems. They work in large groups to improve a common code base, giving them practical exposure to many of the problems and difficulties of developing software on realistic projects. (e.g. People breaking code or changing the design, working with difficult existing code, managing change in the code base, and other issues.) Some of the tools and techniques support version control, build systems, requirements management, continuous integration, test-driven development, mocks, refactoring, API design, code coverage and analysis tools, database integration, and more.

To support the learning objectives, we have developed a [game engine](https://github.com/UQdeco2800/game-engine) that is used as the basis for their project. The game engine provides a fun environment in which students can develop a real game over the duration of the semester. In doing so, they are required to learn how to manage developing a large project. This organisation hosts the game engine and the finished games that have been published as open source projects.

You are welcome to use the game engine for your own purposes. It is released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "MIT License Description"). Acknowledgment of the source of the game engine is required.

**Large Teams** -- In the context of this course, a *large* team could be anywhere from 25 to 60 students.
